Day 3 Task1:
===========
1. For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)


For Loop:
========
The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’. Next, the terminal or final value is specified. The For Loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.

var numbers = [ 10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
for (var i=0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
   console.log(numbers[i])
}

var elements = document.querySelectorAll("a");
for (var i=0; i<elements.length; i++) {
   elements[i].style.color = "red";
}

For in loop:
===========
Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.

var person = {
   fname: "Nick",
   lname: "Jonas",
   age: 26
}; 
for (let x in person) {
   console.log(x + ": "+ person[x])
}

For of loop:
===========
This for of statement lets you loop over the data structures that are iterable such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, Node Lists, and more. It calls a custom iteration hook with instructions to execute on the value of each property of the object.

var text = [
            "Nagendhiran",
            "Full stack developer", 
            "01"
            ];
        var userId = "";

        for (var i of text) {
        userId+=i;
        }
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = userId;


Difference between Forin and forof loop:
======================================
Forin loops over enumerable property names of an object.

For of loops over the values generated by that.

let list = [4, 5, 6];

for (let i in list) {
   console.log(i); // "0", "1", "2",
}

for (let i of list) {
   console.log(i); // "4", "5", "6"
}


Foreach loop:
============
The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.

The forEach() method is not executed for empty elements.

let text = "";
const fruits = ["apple", "orange", "cherry"];
fruits.forEach(myFunction(item, index) {
  text += index + ": " + item + "<br>"; 
});
console.log(text);
